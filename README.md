# About
This repository contains a number of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. These notbooks
provide an introduction to programming in Python.

The focus of the matrial are students with 
little or none previous programmin experience, especially in non-technical courses of study. 
To support these students in learning the complex skill of programming, the
*[Four Components Instructional Design (4C/ID)](http://www.tensteps.info/)* method was used to create the material.
